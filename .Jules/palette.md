## 2024-05-23 - Full Page Empty States
**Learning:** `WorkflowEmptyState` is designed for lists but works well for full-page error states when styled with `h-full` and `border-none`. This maintains visual consistency across the application.
**Action:** Prefer reusing `WorkflowEmptyState` for 404/Error pages instead of creating custom ad-hoc layouts.
